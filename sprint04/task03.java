//Suppose we have the next class:
//class Employee {
//    public String fullName;
//    public float salary;
//}
//Create a new version of the Employee class that correspond next principles:
//All class fields must be private.
//Get and set methods must be used to access the class fields.
//The class must have a constructors with and without parameters.
//For correct passing of all tests don't use print and println methods in your code.
